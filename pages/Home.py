    - Upload an image or enter a URL for some type of :green[**data visualization**];
    e.g., line graph📉, bart chart📊, etc., or even dataframe-like tables.

Hey Learners! 
Our mission to make your learning journey :orange[**smoother**] 
and :orange[**smarter**] continues, and these new features are all about enhancing your experience.

##### Feature Updates:

1. **Pages:** The site is now organized in pages. The sidebar on left of the
page 👈 will include links to various *rooms*.

2. **Conversations:** Chat it up! Our new conversational AI feature allows you to 
engage in :green[**dynamic learning sessions**]. Ask questions, build upon previous ones, 
or explore new topics - the conversation flows just like it would with a real-life tutor.

3. **Code Conversion:** 
    \n\t - Converting code is even more accurate than ever. When :green[**Code Conversion**]
     is selected, the selected model will be overriden and the *GPT-4* model will be mandatory. 
     The latest models produce more accurate and efficient conversions.
    \n\t - Your :green[**natural language to SQL queries**]  just got a major performance boost. 
We've fine-tuned the translation process to ensure your instructions are 
converted into more efficient and smarter SQL statements. During testing, the
 *GPT-4 Turbo* model produced very accurate and advanced
  SQL statements even from highly complicated prompts.

4. **Persistent History:** Say goodbye to repetition. 
Our :green[**cross-page history**] functionality means that no matter where you navigate
 within Code Tutor, your dialogue and activity history follows. Seamless 
 learning without the hassle of backtracking.

*We're always working to make Code Tutor more intuitive and responsive to 
your needs. Dive in, explore the updates, and let's code smarter, not harder!*

##### Other Changes:
- The :green[**GPT-4**] model is now the *default* model. This model is
highly recommended for most code related tasks as it produces more accurate code
and follows instructions closer than previous models (i.e. gpt-3)
- The latest model :green[**GPT-4 Turbo**] has been added as an available option. This
is the most advanced model that OpenAI currently offers, and most importantly
it has *knowledge about the world up to Apr 2023*. While it is still new, 
this model is recommended for more complex coding tasks, especially
*converting code*.
- Currently the download button will save a markdown file for the *most recently 
generated response* on the page. A future update will allow downloading the entire output in 
one file from a single button on the page.
